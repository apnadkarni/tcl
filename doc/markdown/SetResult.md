# Description

The procedures described here are utilities for manipulating the result value in a Tcl interpreter. The interpreter result may be either a Tcl value or a string. For example, **Tcl_SetObjResult** and **Tcl_SetResult** set the interpreter result to, respectively, a value and a string. Similarly, **Tcl_GetObjResult** and **Tcl_GetStringResult** return the interpreter result as a value and as a string. The procedures always keep the string and value forms of the interpreter result consistent. For example, if **Tcl_SetObjResult** is called to set the result to a value, then **Tcl_GetStringResult** is called, it will return the value's string representation.

**Tcl_SetObjResult** arranges for *objPtr* to be the result for *interp*, replacing any existing result. The result is left pointing to the value referenced by *objPtr*. *objPtr*'s reference count is incremented since there is now a new reference to it from *interp*. The reference count for any old result value is decremented and the old result value is freed if no references to it remain.

**Tcl_GetObjResult** returns the result for *interp* as a value. The value's reference count is not incremented; if the caller needs to retain a long-term pointer to the value they should use **Tcl_IncrRefCount** to increment its reference count in order to keep it from being freed too early or accidentally changed.

**Tcl_SetResult** arranges for *result* to be the result for the current Tcl command in *interp*, replacing any existing result. The *freeProc* argument specifies how to manage the storage for the *result* argument; it is discussed in the section **THE TCL_FREEPROC ARGUMENT TO TCL_SETRESULT** below. If *result* is **NULL**, then *freeProc* is ignored and **Tcl_SetResult** re-initializes *interp*'s result to point to an empty string.

**Tcl_GetStringResult** returns the result for *interp* as a string. If the result was set to a value by a **Tcl_SetObjResult** call, the value form will be converted to a string and returned. If the value's string representation contains null bytes, this conversion will lose information. For this reason, programmers are encouraged to write their code to use the new value API procedures and to call **Tcl_GetObjResult** instead.

**Tcl_ResetResult** clears the result for *interp* and leaves the result in its normal empty initialized state. If the result is a value, its reference count is decremented and the result is left pointing to an unshared value representing an empty string. If the result is a dynamically allocated string, its memory is free*d and the result is left as a empty string. **Tcl_ResetResult** also clears the error state managed by **Tcl_AddErrorInfo**, **Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo**, and **Tcl_SetErrorCode**.

**Tcl_AppendResult** makes it easy to build up Tcl results in pieces. It takes each of its *result* arguments and appends them in order to the current result associated with *interp*. If the result is in its initialized empty state (e.g. a command procedure was just invoked or **Tcl_ResetResult** was just called), then **Tcl_AppendResult** sets the result to the concatenation of its *result* arguments. **Tcl_AppendResult** may be called repeatedly as additional pieces of the result are produced. **Tcl_AppendResult** takes care of all the storage management issues associated with managing *interp*'s result, such as allocating a larger result area if necessary. It also manages conversion to and from the *result* field of the *interp* so as to handle backward-compatibility with old-style extensions. Any number of *result* arguments may be passed in a single call; the last argument in the list must be (char *)NULL.

**Tcl_TransferResult** transfers interpreter state from *sourceInterp* to *targetInterp*. The two interpreters must have been created in the same thread.  If *sourceInterp* and *targetInterp* are the same, nothing is done. Otherwise, **Tcl_TransferResult** moves the result from *sourceInterp* to *targetInterp*, and resets the result in *sourceInterp*. It also moves the return options dictionary as controlled by the return code value *code* in the same manner as **Tcl_GetReturnOptions**.

# Deprecated interfaces

## Old string procedures

Use of the following procedures is deprecated since they manipulate the Tcl result as a string. Procedures such as **Tcl_SetObjResult** that manipulate the result as a value can be significantly more efficient.

**Tcl_AppendElement** is similar to **Tcl_AppendResult** in that it allows results to be built up in pieces. However, **Tcl_AppendElement** takes only a single *element* argument and it appends that argument to the current result as a proper Tcl list element. **Tcl_AppendElement** adds backslashes or braces if necessary to ensure that *interp*'s result can be parsed as a list and that *element* will be extracted as a single element. Under normal conditions, **Tcl_AppendElement** will add a space character to *interp*'s result just before adding the new list element, so that the list elements in the result are properly separated. However if the new list element is the first in a list or sub-list (i.e. *interp*'s current result is empty, or consists of the single character "{", or ends in the characters " {") then no space is added.

# The tcl_freeproc argument to tcl_setresult

**Tcl_SetResult**'s *freeProc* argument specifies how the Tcl system is to manage the storage for the *result* argument. If **Tcl_SetResult** or **Tcl_SetObjResult** are called at a time when *interp* holds a string result, they do whatever is necessary to dispose of the old string result (see the **Tcl_Interp** manual entry for details on this).

If *freeProc* is **TCL_STATIC** it means that *result* refers to an area of static storage that is guaranteed not to be modified until at least the next call to **Tcl_Eval**. If *freeProc* is **TCL_DYNAMIC** it means that *result* was allocated with a call to **Tcl_Alloc** and is now the property of the Tcl system. **Tcl_SetResult** will arrange for the string's storage to be released by calling **Tcl_Free** when it is no longer needed. If *freeProc* is **TCL_VOLATILE** it means that *result* points to an area of memory that is likely to be overwritten when **Tcl_SetResult** returns (e.g. it points to something in a stack frame). In this case **Tcl_SetResult** will make a copy of the string in dynamically allocated storage and arrange for the copy to be the result for the current Tcl command.

If *freeProc* is not one of the values **TCL_STATIC**, **TCL_DYNAMIC**, and **TCL_VOLATILE**, then it is the address of a procedure that Tcl should call to free the string. This allows applications to use non-standard storage allocators. When Tcl no longer needs the storage for the string, it will call *freeProc*. *FreeProc* should have arguments and result that match the type **Tcl_FreeProc**:

```
typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(
        void *blockPtr);
```

When *freeProc* is called, its *blockPtr* will be set to the value of *result* passed to **Tcl_SetResult**. 

# Reference count management

The interpreter result is one of the main places that owns references to values, along with the bytecode execution stack, argument lists, variables, and the list and dictionary collection values.

**Tcl_SetObjResult** takes a value with an arbitrary reference count *(specifically including zero)* and guarantees to increment the reference count. If code wishes to continue using the value after setting it as the result, it should add its own reference to it with **Tcl_IncrRefCount**.

**Tcl_GetObjResult** returns the current interpreter result value. This will have a reference count of at least 1. If the caller wishes to keep the interpreter result value, it should increment its reference count.

**Tcl_GetStringResult** does not manipulate reference counts, but the string it returns is owned by (and has a lifetime controlled by) the current interpreter result value; it should be copied instead of being relied upon to persist after the next Tcl API call, as most Tcl operations can modify the interpreter result.

**Tcl_SetResult**, **Tcl_AppendResult**, **Tcl_AppendElement**, and **Tcl_ResetResult** all modify the interpreter result. They may cause the old interpreter result to have its reference count decremented and a new interpreter result to be allocated. After they have been called, the reference count of the interpreter result is guaranteed to be 1.
